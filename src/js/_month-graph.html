  <p>The red dashed line marks the introduction of dockless bikeshare to Seattle. The dashed black line shows the average number of bikes counted per day from month to month, calculated from public data. There are some gaps in the data, for example due to broken bike counters, so the solid black line traces a path that attempts to correct for these errors: Days where the bike count was less than 10% of this counter's overall average were thrown out.</p>
